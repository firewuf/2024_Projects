This is an implementation of singly linked lists from scratch under the
context of a Futsal team that needs to create a queue of players who
want to try out for the team. The Queue is a struct which contains the
queue/linked list's size, and pointers to its first and last
elements. The pointers point to a struct called LLNode, which holds the
pointers to the Player and the next node in the list, if any.
