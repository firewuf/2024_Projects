This is an implementation of doubly linked lists using classes in the
context of a list of artists. ArtistList is the class that encapsulates
and manages the doubly linked list. The nodes are called ArtistEntry,
which hold pointers to the next and previous Entry, as well as to the
Artist and a pointer back to the ArtistList.
